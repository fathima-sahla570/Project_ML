Employee Data Analysis Project â€“ Python Module Final Assignment
Congratulations on completing the Python module! As a final project, you will apply your skills in data preprocessing, analysis,
and visualization using a real-world dataset from ABC Company. This dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, capturing essential employee information across various teams and positions.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to clean and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful insights for the company.
By performing data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and graphical representation, you will help ABC Company understand trends related to team distribution, employee positions, salary expenditure,
and age demographics.

Key Tasks:
Preprocessing:

Correct inconsistencies in the "height" column by replacing values with random numbers between 150 and 180.

Ensure overall data integrity before proceeding with analysis.

Data Analysis:

Employee Distribution: Determine the number and percentage of employees in each team.

Position Segmentation: Categorize employees based on their roles within the company.

Age Group Analysis: Identify the predominant age group.

Salary Analysis: Find the team and position with the highest salary expenditure.

Correlation Study: Investigate if there's a relationship between age and salary, and visualize the findings.

Graphical Representation:

Use appropriate charts and graphs to visualize insights from each analysis task.

Data Storytelling & Insights:

Summarize the key patterns, trends, and correlations discovered in the dataset.

Project Submission Guidelines:
Upload your project on GitHub, ensuring:

A README file summarizing preprocessing steps, analysis, and insights.

A Jupyter Notebook with well-documented code.

The dataset is included in the repository.

Submit the GitHub repository link via Google Classroom.

Why This Project Matters?
This project will test your ability to handle real-world datasets, apply Python programming, and derive meaningful business insights through data visualization. It will also help you build a strong portfolio demonstrating your analytical and programming skills.
